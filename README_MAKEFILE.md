# ðŸŽ¯ New Root-Level Makefile

## What's New?

The project now has a **smart root-level Makefile** that orchestrates all sub-projects. You can now run ALL commands from the project root without navigating to sub-directories!

## Quick Examples

```bash
# From project root (no need to cd into sub-directories!)
make start          # Start all backend services
make ui             # Start the UI development server
make dev            # Start everything (backend + frontend)
make test           # Run all tests
make help           # See all available commands
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No More Directory Navigation** - Everything works from root
2. **Intelligent Command Routing** - Commands automatically go to the right sub-project
3. **Unified Interface** - Consistent commands across all modules
4. **Backwards Compatible** - All your existing commands still work

## Common Workflows

### First Time Setup
```bash
make all            # Sets up and starts everything
```

### Daily Development
```bash
make dev            # Start complete dev environment
# OR
make start          # Start backend only
make ui             # Start UI in another terminal
```

### Testing
```bash
make test           # Run all tests
make ui-test        # Run UI tests only
make test-java      # Run Java tests
```

### Session Management (No More Timeouts!)
```bash
make login          # Login with demo credentials
make keep-alive     # Run in separate terminal to prevent timeouts
```

## Sub-Project Commands

Any UI-specific command can be run with the `ui-` prefix:
```bash
make ui-lint        # Lint the UI code
make ui-build       # Build UI for production
make ui-help        # See all UI-specific commands
```
