  - Find workflows by node type
  - Find workflows by node count range
  - Time-based queries (created/updated)
  - Organization-based isolation
- **Workflow analysis**:
  - Path existence checking
  - Cycle detection
  - Orphaned edge detection
  - Maximum path length calculation

#### 5. Performance Indexing and Constraints
- **Primary constraints**: Unique IDs for workflows, nodes, and edges
- **Data integrity constraints**: Required fields validation
- **Performance indexes**: 
  - Single-column indexes for common queries
  - Composite indexes for complex queries
  - Full-text search indexes
  - Range indexes for time-based queries
- **Graph traversal optimization**: Relationship indexes for efficient path queries

#### 6. Configuration and Setup
- **Neo4jConfig**: Spring configuration with constraint initialization
- **Application configuration**: Neo4j connection and performance settings
- **Constraint initialization**: Automated setup of indexes and constraints
- **Connection pooling**: Optimized for high-performance operations

### ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented

#### Advanced Cypher Queries
```cypher
// Complex filtering with multiple conditions
MATCH (w:Workflow) WHERE w.organizationId = $organizationId 
AND ($statuses IS NULL OR w.status IN $statuses) 
AND ($nodeTypes IS NULL OR EXISTS((w)-[:CONTAINS]->(n:WorkflowNode) WHERE n.type IN $nodeTypes))
RETURN w ORDER BY w.updatedAt DESC

// Workflow structure analysis
MATCH (w:Workflow)-[:CONTAINS]->(start:WorkflowNode)-[:CONNECTS_TO*]->(end:WorkflowNode) 
WHERE w.id = $workflowId AND start.id = $startNodeId AND end.id = $endNodeId 
RETURN EXISTS((start)-[:CONNECTS_TO*]->(end))

// Full-text search integration
CALL db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('workflow_search_idx', $searchTerm) 
YIELD node, score WHERE node.organizationId = $organizationId 
RETURN node ORDER BY score DESC
```
