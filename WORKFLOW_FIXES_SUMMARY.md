# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Maven ClassNotFoundException: #
**Root Cause**: Maven commands were missing the batch mode flags, causing Maven to interpret shell comments or special characters as class names.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `MAVEN_BATCH_MODE: '--batch-mode --no-transfer-progress --show-version'` to all workflows
- Updated all Maven commands to use `${{ env.MAVEN_BATCH_MODE }}`
- Fixed duplicate MAVEN_BATCH_MODE entries in commands

**Affected Workflows**: 14 workflows updated

### 2. NPM Cache Errors
**Error**: "Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies"

**Fix Applied**:
- Added cache configuration to all setup-node actions:
  ```yaml
  cache: 'npm'
  cache-dependency-path: [appropriate-path]/package-lock.json
  ```

**Affected Workflows**:
- workflow-health-monitor-debug.yml
- code-quality.yml
- workflow-failure-handler.yml
- workflow-failure-monitoring.yml
- workflow-health-monitor.yml

### 3. Other Fixes
- Disabled scheduled trigger for workflow-health-monitor-debug.yml (was running every 15 minutes)
- Fixed incremental-test-detector action.yml syntax error (removed invalid `shell: bash` from checkout step)

## Verification Scripts Created

1. **monitor-workflow-status.js** - Real-time monitoring of workflow runs and errors
2. **fix-maven-batch-mode.js** - Automated script to fix Maven commands across all workflows
3. **validate-maven-build.sh** - Validation script for Maven builds

## Current Status

As of the latest push:
- Some workflows are now running successfully (e.g., Incremental Linting passed)
- Some workflows still have failures that need investigation:
  - Build Validation
  - Workflow Editor CI/CD
  - CI/CD pipelines

## Next Steps

1. Monitor workflow runs to see which are now passing
2. Investigate remaining failures (likely unrelated to Maven batch mode)
3. The fixes should have resolved the "Could not find or load main class #" errors

## Commands to Monitor

```bash
# Check workflow status
node scripts/monitor-workflow-status.js

# View recent runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Check specific workflow logs
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log
```
