# Runbook: Data Breach Response

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Alert**: Potential data breach detected  
**Automated Response**: Evidence preservation and access lockdown  

---

## üö® Alert Triggers

- **Data Exfiltration**: Large volume data downloads detected
- **Unauthorized Access**: Access to sensitive data from unknown source
- **Database Anomaly**: Unusual database query patterns
- **API Abuse**: Bulk data export via API
- **Insider Threat**: Privileged user accessing excessive data

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 15 Minutes)

### 1. Contain the Breach
```bash
# CRITICAL: Stop active data exfiltration
curl -X POST "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/emergency/data-lockdown" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"severity":"CRITICAL","preserveEvidence":true}'

# This will:
# - Block all data export endpoints
# - Terminate suspicious sessions
# - Enable read-only mode for databases
# - Preserve audit logs
```

### 2. Identify Breach Scope
```bash
# Get breach analysis
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/breach/analysis" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '{
    dataAccessed: .summary.dataTypes,
    recordsAffected: .summary.totalRecords,
    timeWindow: {
      start: .summary.firstAccess,
      end: .summary.lastAccess
    },
    sources: .summary.accessSources
  }'

# Identify affected users
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/breach/affected-users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" > affected_users_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json
```

### 3. Preserve Evidence
```bash
# Create forensic snapshot
curl -X POST "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/forensics/snapshot" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "includeDatabase": true,
    "includeLogs": true,
    "includeNetworkTraffic": true,
    "encryptSnapshot": true
  }'

# Download audit logs
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/audit/export?hours=48" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" > breach_audit_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json
```

## üîç Breach Assessment (Next 30 Minutes)

### 1. Data Classification
```bash
# Determine data sensitivity
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/breach/data-classification" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '.classification[] | {
    dataType: .type,
    sensitivity: .level,
    compliance: .regulations,
    recordCount: .count,
    containsPII: .hasPII,
    containsPHI: .hasPHI,
    containsFinancial: .hasFinancial
  }'
```

### 2. Attack Vector Analysis
```bash
# Identify how the breach occurred
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/breach/attack-vector" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Common vectors:
# - Compromised credentials
# - SQL injection
# - API key leak
# - Insider threat
# - Social engineering
```

### 3. Timeline Reconstruction
```bash
# Build breach timeline
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/breach/timeline" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '.events[] | {
    time: .timestamp,
    action: .action,
    user: .userId,
    ip: .sourceIp,
    data: .dataAccessed,
    volume: .recordCount
  }'
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Containment Actions

### Case 1: External Attacker
```bash
# 1. Block all attacker access points
curl -X POST "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/block/comprehensive" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ips": ["$ATTACKER_IP1", "$ATTACKER_IP2"],
    "userIds": ["$COMPROMISED_USER_ID"],
    "apiKeys": ["$LEAKED_API_KEY"],
    "permanent": true
  }'

# 2. Reset all potentially compromised credentials
curl -X POST "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/credentials/mass-reset" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scope":"organization","forceMFA":true}'

# 3. Patch vulnerability
# Deploy emergency patch based on attack vector
```

### Case 2: Insider Threat
```bash
# 1. Immediately disable user access
curl -X POST "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/users/$USER_ID/emergency-disable" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preserveEvidence":true,"notifyLegal":true}'

# 2. Revoke all access tokens
curl -X DELETE "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/tokens/user/$USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# 3. Audit all user activities
curl -X POST "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/audit/deep-scan" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"$USER_ID","daysBack":90,"includeDeleted":true}'
```
