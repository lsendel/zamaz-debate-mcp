---

## üîç Initial Assessment (10 minutes)

### 1. User Behavior Analysis
```bash
# Get user risk score and recent activities
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/users/$USER_ID/risk-assessment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '{
    riskScore: .score,
    riskLevel: .level,
    anomalies: .anomalies[],
    recentActivities: .activities[0:10] | map({
      time: .timestamp,
      action: .action,
      resource: .resource,
      anomalyScore: .score
    })
  }'

# Compare to baseline behavior
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/users/$USER_ID/baseline-deviation" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Access Pattern Review
```bash
# Analyze data access patterns
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/audit/user-access/$USER_ID?days=30" \

      type: .[0].dataType,
      count: length,
      sensitive: .[0].isSensitive
    }),
    unusualAccess: .anomalies[],
    downloadVolume: .metrics.totalDownloadMB,
    afterHoursAccess: .metrics.afterHoursPercentage
  }'
```

### 3. Privilege Usage Analysis
```bash
# Check for privilege escalation or abuse
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/privileges/usage/$USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '{
    elevatedActions: .privilegedActions[],
