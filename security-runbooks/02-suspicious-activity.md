---

## üîç Initial Assessment (3 minutes)

### 1. Identify Attack Type
```bash
# Check recent security violations
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/violations/recent?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '{
    total: .count,
    types: [.violations[].type] | group_by(.) | map({type: .[0], count: length})
  }'

# Common attack types:
# - XSS_ATTEMPT
# - SQL_INJECTION
# - PATH_TRAVERSAL
# - SCANNER_DETECTED
# - PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION
```

### 2. Analyze Attack Source
```bash
# Get attacker details
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/attackers/active" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '.attackers[] | {
    ip: .clientIp,
    userAgent: .userAgent,
    requestCount: .totalRequests,
    violationCount: .violations,
    firstSeen: .firstActivity,
    lastSeen: .lastActivity
  }'
```

### 3. Check Impact
```bash
# Assess potential impact
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/security/impact-assessment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Key metrics:
# - Affected endpoints
# - Data access attempts
# - Authentication bypass attempts
# - System resource impact
```
