- **User Impact**: Minimal disruption

#### Alternative Options:
- **Parallel Development**: 24 weeks, larger team, medium risk
- **Big Bang**: 10 weeks, full team, high risk

### 3. **Technical Architecture**

```
Recommended Stack:
├── UI Framework: React 18+ with TypeScript
├── Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS-in-JS hybrid
├── Components: Radix UI (headless) + Custom
├── State: Zustand + React Query
├── Build: Vite
└── Testing: Vitest + Playwright
```

### 4. **Week-by-Week Breakdown**

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### 1. **Design Language**
- **Primary Color**: Deep Intelligence Blue (#0066ff)
- **Typography**: Inter font family
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit system
- **Border Radius**: Subtle curves (6-12px)
- **Shadows**: Minimal, functional elevation

### 2. **Technical Choices**
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible headless components
- **CVA** for component variants
- **Zustand** to unify state management
- **Vite** for fast builds across all apps

### 3. **Migration Approach**
- Component-by-component replacement
- Feature flags for safe rollout
- Maintain full functionality throughout
- Continuous testing and monitoring
