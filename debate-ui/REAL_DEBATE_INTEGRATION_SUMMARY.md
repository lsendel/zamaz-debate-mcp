### 🔍 **Identified Real LLM Usage Patterns**

From the backend data analysis, **real debates are happening**:

1. **Healthcare AI Ethics Debate (debate-001)**
   - Claude 3 Opus vs GPT-4
   - 3 complete rounds with substantive arguments
   - Token counts: 89-98 tokens per response
   - Evidence-based argumentation on both sides

2. **Climate Nuclear Energy Debate (debate-002)**  
   - Claude 3 Sonnet vs Gemini Pro
   - Currently in progress (Round 2)
   - Real environmental policy arguments
   - Technical details about renewable vs nuclear

3. **Automation Jobs Debate (debate-003)**
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo vs Claude 3 Opus
   - Complex socioeconomic arguments
   - 922-923 token responses (substantial content)
   - Nuanced position evolution over rounds

### 🚨 **Known Issues & Solutions**
