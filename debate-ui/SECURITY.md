# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and tools implemented in the debate-ui project.

## Security Tools

### 1. ESLint Security Plugin
- **Plugin**: `eslint-plugin-security`
- **Purpose**: Detects common security vulnerabilities in JavaScript/TypeScript code
- **Configuration**: `.eslintrc.js`

#### Key Rules:
- `security/detect-object-injection`: Prevents object injection vulnerabilities
- `security/detect-non-literal-regexp`: Flags non-literal regex patterns
- `security/detect-unsafe-regex`: Detects potentially unsafe regex patterns
- `security/detect-eval-with-expression`: Prevents eval() usage
- `react/no-danger`: Warns about dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
- `react/jsx-no-target-blank`: Prevents target="_blank" without rel="noopener noreferrer"

### 2. Semgrep
- **Tool**: Static analysis security scanner
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security vulnerability detection
- **Usage**: `npm run security:scan`

#### Features:
- React-specific security rules
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
- Custom rule support
- CI/CD integration

### 3. NPM Audit
- **Tool**: Built-in dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Purpose**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Usage**: `npm run security:audit`

## Security Scripts

Run these commands to perform security checks:

```bash
# Run all security checks
npm run security:check

# Individual checks
npm run lint:security    # ESLint security rules
npm run security:scan    # Semgrep analysis
npm run security:audit   # Dependency audit
```

## CI/CD Security

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
- **Checks**:
  - Semgrep security scan
  - ESLint security rules
  - Dependency vulnerability audit

### Integration with GitHub Security
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- SARIF format for better integration
- Automated security alerts

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Input Validation
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML when possible

### 2. Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review dependency audit reports
- Use exact versions in production

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Validate JWT tokens properly

### 4. Data Protection
- Never log sensitive information
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper error handling

### 5. Code Quality
- Regular security scans
- Code reviews for security implications
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Pre-commit hooks (planned)
- CI/CD pipeline security gates
- Dependency vulnerability alerts

### Manual Reviews
- Regular security audits
- Code review security checklist
- Penetration testing (recommended)

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the project maintainers
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for assessment and fix before disclosure

## Security Updates

- Security fixes are prioritized
- Dependencies updated regularly
- Security advisories communicated promptly

## Compliance

This project follows:
- OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- React security best practices
- Node.js security recommendations
- Industry standard secure coding practices
