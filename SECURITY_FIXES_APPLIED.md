# Security Fixes Applied

## Issue Fixed
GitHub detected exposed API keys in the repository history and blocked the push.

## Actions Taken

1. **Removed API Keys from .env file**
   - Replaced actual API keys with placeholder values
   - OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google API keys were exposed

2. **Added .env to .gitignore**
   - Added `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.env.*.local` to .gitignore
   - This prevents future accidental commits of sensitive data

3. **Removed .env from Git History**
   - Used `git filter-branch` to remove .env from all commits
   - Cleaned up repository with `git gc`
   - Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub

4. **Environment Variables Setup**
   - All application.yml files already use environment variables:
     - `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:}` for Claude
     - `${OPENAI_API_KEY:}` for OpenAI
     - `${GOOGLE_API_KEY:}` for Google/Gemini
   - Docker Compose properly passes these variables to containers

## Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL: Revoke Exposed API Keys**
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Google: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Generate New API Keys**
   - Create new API keys after revoking the old ones
   - Store them securely, never in the repository

3. **Team Communication**
   - All team members must re-clone or reset their local repos
   - The git history has been rewritten

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Keep `.env.example` with placeholder values for documentation
4. Use secrets management tools for production environments
5. Consider pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental secret commits

## How to Use Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your actual API keys in `.env`
3. Docker Compose will automatically load these when running services
4. Spring Boot reads them via `${VARIABLE_NAME:default}` syntax
