# 🔐 Login Instructions

## ✅ **Development Login Credentials**

Since the backend services are not running, I've set up mock authentication for you to explore the UI.

### **Use these credentials to log in:**

```
Username: demo
Password: demo123
```

## 📋 **Steps to Login:**

1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:3001`
2. **On the login page**, enter:
   - Username: `demo`
   - Password: `demo123`
3. **Click the Login button**
4. You'll be logged in and can explore the UI!

## 🎯 **What You Can Do After Login:**

Once logged in with the demo credentials, you can:
- ✅ View the main dashboard
- ✅ Navigate through different sections
- ✅ See the UI layout and design
- ✅ Test responsive behavior
- ✅ Explore the interface

## ⚠️ **Note:**

- This is a **development mode** login that works without backend services
- API calls to create debates, fetch data, etc. will fail without the backend
- This is perfect for UI testing and development
- The mock token expires when you refresh the page

## 🚀 **Want Full Functionality?**

To use real authentication and all features:
1. Build and start the Java backend services
2. Use real database credentials
3. Create actual user accounts

For now, the `demo` / `demo123` credentials will let you explore the UI!
