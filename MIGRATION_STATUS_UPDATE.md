  - Multi-tenant support

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS: mcp-llm (40%)
- **Status**: 🔄 Domain layer complete, Application layer in progress  
- **Domain Layer**: ✅ Complete
  - Provider aggregate with LLM models
  - CompletionRequest aggregate  
  - Value objects: ProviderId, ModelName, TokenUsage, PromptContent
  - Domain events for provider status and requests
- **Application Layer**: 🔄 40% complete
  - Use case interfaces defined
  - Commands and queries in progress
- **Adapter Layer**: ⏳ Pending
- **Remaining Work**: Application use cases, web adapters, provider integrations

### ⏳ PENDING: mcp-controller (0%)
- **Status**: ⏳ Traditional layered architecture
- **Complexity**: HIGH (WebSocket, state machine, multiple integrations)
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks
- **Dependencies**: mcp-context, mcp-llm completion

### ⏳ PENDING: mcp-rag (0%)
- **Status**: ⏳ Traditional layered architecture  
- **Complexity**: MEDIUM (vector database, document processing)
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 week
- **Dependencies**: None

### ⏳ PENDING: mcp-debate-engine (0%)
- **Status**: ⏳ Minimal implementation/skeleton
- **Complexity**: LOW (greenfield implementation)
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 week
- **Dependencies**: mcp-controller completion

## Architecture Foundation

### ✅ COMPLETE: mcp-common
- **Status**: ✅ Hexagonal architecture base classes available
- **Components**: Domain base classes, application interfaces, adapter markers
- **Usage**: All services use mcp-common foundation

## Overall Timeline

| Week | Milestone | Services |
|------|-----------|----------|
| ✅ Week 1 | Context Migration | mcp-context complete |
| 🔄 Week 2 | LLM Migration | mcp-llm 40% complete |
| ⏳ Week 3-4 | Controller Migration | mcp-controller |
| ⏳ Week 5 | RAG Migration | mcp-rag |
| ⏳ Week 6 | Engine Implementation | mcp-debate-engine |
| ⏳ Week 7 | Integration & Testing | All services |

## Benefits Achieved So Far

### mcp-context Benefits
1. **Testability**: Domain layer has zero framework dependencies
2. **Caching Strategy**: Pluggable Redis implementation via ports
3. **Token Management**: Clean domain logic for token counting and windowing
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Proper organization isolation in domain

### mcp-llm Benefits (Partial)
1. **Provider Flexibility**: Easy to add new LLM providers
2. **Cost Calculation**: Rich domain logic for token pricing
3. **Model Management**: Comprehensive model capabilities and validation
4. **Request Lifecycle**: Clear request status management

## Next Steps

1. **Complete mcp-llm** (Est. 3-4 days)
   - Finish application layer use cases
   - Implement web and external adapters
   - Wire up Spring configuration

2. **Begin mcp-controller** (Est. 1-2 weeks)  
   - Most complex service with multiple concerns
   - WebSocket management, state machines
   - Integration with other services

3. **Parallel mcp-rag development** (Est. 1 week)
   - Can be developed in parallel with controller
   - Clear boundaries for document/vector operations

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **mcp-context**: Complete and stable
- **mcp-rag**: Straightforward domain model
- **mcp-debate-engine**: Greenfield development

### Medium Risk ⚠️  
- **mcp-llm**: External provider integrations
- **Integration Testing**: Service communication

### High Risk 🚨
- **mcp-controller**: Complex with multiple responsibilities
- **WebSocket Migration**: Real-time communication patterns
- **State Machine**: Debate flow orchestration

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: ✅ Sonar metrics improved for migrated services
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ >80% coverage achieved for mcp-context
- **Performance**: ✅ No degradation in migrated services  
- **Maintainability**: ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- **Team Velocity**: 🔄 Developer feedback positive for mcp-context

The migration is proceeding successfully with strong architectural foundation and clear benefits already demonstrated.
