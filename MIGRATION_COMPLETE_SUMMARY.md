## Implementation Highlights

### Architecture Patterns Used
- ✅ **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters)
- ✅ **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) 
- ✅ **Command Query Responsibility Segregation** (CQRS)
- ✅ **Repository Pattern** with domain ports
- ✅ **Aggregate Root Pattern** for consistency boundaries
- ✅ **Value Objects** with rich business logic
- ✅ **Domain Events** for decoupled communication

### Code Quality Achievements
- ✅ **Rich Domain Models** with encapsulated business logic
- ✅ **Type-Safe Value Objects** preventing primitive obsession
- ✅ **Comprehensive Validation** at domain boundaries
- ✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns** across all layers
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion** enabling testability
- ✅ **Configuration-Driven** behavior for flexibility

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ **Unit Tests** for all domain models and business rules
- ✅ **Integration Tests** for API endpoints and persistence
- ✅ **Domain Logic Tests** for complex business scenarios
- ✅ **Value Object Tests** for validation and behavior
- ✅ **Use Case Tests** for application logic flows

### Production Readiness
- ✅ **Database Migrations** with Flyway for all services
- ✅ **Environment Configuration** for deployment flexibility
- ✅ **Error Handling** with comprehensive exception management
- ✅ **Logging Integration** with structured event logging
- ✅ **API Documentation** with OpenAPI/Swagger
- ✅ **Docker Support** with proper containerization

## Key Benefits Delivered
