if [ -z "$PREVIOUS_VERSION" ]; then
  echo "❌ No previous version found"
  exit 1
fi

echo "🔄 Rolling back to version: $PREVIOUS_VERSION"

# Update deployment
kubectl set image deployment/mcp-organization mcp-organization=ghcr.io/your-org/mcp-organization:$PREVIOUS_VERSION -n $ENVIRONMENT
kubectl set image deployment/mcp-llm mcp-llm=ghcr.io/your-org/mcp-llm:$PREVIOUS_VERSION -n $ENVIRONMENT
