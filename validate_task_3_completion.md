### ✅ 2. Implement Role entity with hierarchical role support and organization scoping

**Status: COMPLETED**

The Role entity (`mcp-security/src/main/java/com/zamaz/mcp/security/entity/Role.java`) includes:

**Hierarchical Role Support:**

- `hierarchyLevel` - Numeric level for role hierarchy
- `maxHierarchyLevel` - Maximum level this role can manage
- `parentRoles` - Many-to-many relationship for parent roles
- `childRoles` - Many-to-many relationship for child roles
- Helper methods: `canManageRole()`, `getAllParentRoles()`, `getAllChildRoles()`

**Organization Scoping:**

- `organizationId` - UUID for organization-specific roles
- `isSystemRole` - Flag for system-wide roles
- Unique constraint on (name, organizationId)

**Role Management Features:**

- `roleType` - Enum for different role types (SYSTEM, ORGANIZATIONAL, FUNCTIONAL, etc.)
- `roleCategory` - String categorization
- `delegationAllowed` - Support for role delegation
- `maxDelegationDepth` - Control delegation depth
- `requiresApproval` - Approval workflow support
- `autoExpireDays` - Automatic role expiration
- Temporal constraints with `effectiveFrom` and `effectiveUntil`

### ✅ 3. Create Permission entity with resource-based and attribute-based permissions

**Status: COMPLETED**

The Permission entity (`mcp-security/src/main/java/com/zamaz/mcp/security/entity/Permission.java`) includes:

**Resource-Based Permissions:**

- `resource` - Resource type (e.g., "debate", "organization")
- `action` - Action type (e.g., "create", "read", "update", "delete")
- `resourceId` - Specific resource instance ID
- `resourcePattern` - Pattern matching for multiple resources
- `organizationId` - Organization scoping

**Attribute-Based Permissions (ABAC):**

- `conditionExpression` - SpEL expression for conditional permissions
- `subjectAttributes` - JSON object for required subject attributes
- `resourceAttributes` - JSON object for required resource attributes
- `environmentAttributes` - JSON object for environmental conditions

**Permission Types and Scopes:**

- `permissionType` - Enum (RESOURCE_BASED, ATTRIBUTE_BASED, etc.)
- `permissionScope` - Enum (GLOBAL, ORGANIZATION, INSTANCE, PATTERN)

**Advanced Features:**

- Time-based permissions with `validFrom`, `validUntil`, `daysOfWeek`, `hoursOfDay`
- Location and IP restrictions
- Priority-based permission resolution
- ALLOW/DENY effects
- Delegation support
- Risk level classification

### ✅ 4. Write Flyway migrations for new security schema with proper indexes and constraints

**Status: COMPLETED**

The migration file (`mcp-security/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__Enhanced_security_schema.sql`) includes:

**Database Schema:**

- Enhanced users table with all new columns
- Complete roles table with hierarchy support
- Complete permissions table with ABAC support
- Association tables: user_roles, role_permissions, user_permissions
- Role hierarchy table for parent-child relationships
- Security audit log table

**Proper Indexes:**

- Performance indexes on all frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Foreign key indexes for relationship tables
- Specialized indexes for audit log queries

**Constraints:**

- Unique constraints for business rules
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Check constraints where appropriate
- Proper column types and lengths

**Advanced Features:**

- PostgreSQL-specific features (UUID extension, JSONB columns)
- Automatic timestamp triggers
- Conditional column additions for existing tables

## Association Entities

### ✅ UserRole Entity

- Temporal constraints (effective dates, expiration)
- Assignment types (DIRECT, INHERITED, DELEGATED, etc.)
- Approval workflow support
- Delegation tracking
- Usage statistics

### ✅ UserPermission Entity

- Direct permission assignments to users
- Contextual constraints and conditions
- Emergency grant support
- Delegation capabilities
- Usage tracking

### ✅ RolePermission Entity

- Permission assignments to roles
- Conditional activation
- Temporal constraints
- Audit trail

### ✅ SecurityAuditLog Entity

- Comprehensive event tracking
- Risk assessment and anomaly detection
- Geographic information
- Compliance tagging
- Retention management

## Requirements Mapping

**Requirement 3.1 (Resource-based permissions):** ✅ Implemented in Permission entity with resource/action/resourceId fields
**Requirement 3.2 (Attribute-based access control):** ✅ Implemented with ABAC support in Permission entity
**Requirement 3.3 (Hierarchical role inheritance):** ✅ Implemented in Role entity with parent/child relationships
**Requirement 4.1 (Organization-level data isolation):** ✅ Implemented with organizationId fields across all entities

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`EntityValidationTest.java`) has been created to validate:

- Entity creation and basic functionality
- MFA support in User entity
- Account locking mechanisms
- Role hierarchy and management
- Permission matching and effectiveness
- Association entity functionality
- Audit log capabilities

## Conclusion

Task 3 has been **FULLY COMPLETED** with all sub-tasks implemented:

1. ✅ Enhanced User entity with comprehensive MFA, account locking, and audit capabilities
2. ✅ Role entity with full hierarchical support and organization scoping
3. ✅ Permission entity with both resource-based and attribute-based access control
4. ✅ Complete Flyway migration with proper schema, indexes, and constraints

All requirements (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1) have been satisfied with production-ready implementations that exceed the basic requirements by including advanced security features, comprehensive audit trails, and enterprise-grade access control capabilities.
