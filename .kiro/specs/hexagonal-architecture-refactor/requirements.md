# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing Zamaz Debate MCP Services project to implement hexagonal architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters architecture) best practices. The goal is to improve code maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns by clearly defining the boundaries between business logic and external dependencies across all microservices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the business logic to be completely isolated from external dependencies, so that I can easily test and modify core functionality without being coupled to specific frameworks or technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the business logic SHALL be contained within the domain layer with no direct dependencies on external frameworks
2. WHEN external dependencies change THEN the domain layer SHALL remain unaffected and require no modifications
3. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the domain layer SHALL be testable without requiring external infrastructure or frameworks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between inbound and outbound adapters, so that I can easily understand how the application receives input and communicates with external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing REST controllers THEN they SHALL be implemented as inbound adapters that translate HTTP requests to domain operations
2. WHEN implementing database access THEN it SHALL be implemented as outbound adapters that translate domain operations to persistence operations
3. WHEN implementing external API calls THEN they SHALL be implemented as outbound adapters with clear port interfaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined port interfaces, so that I can easily swap implementations and maintain loose coupling between layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining business operations THEN each operation SHALL be exposed through a clearly defined port interface
2. WHEN implementing adapters THEN they SHALL implement port interfaces without exposing implementation details to the domain
3. WHEN the application needs different implementations THEN adapters SHALL be swappable without modifying domain logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent hexagonal architecture implementation across all microservices, so that the codebase maintains architectural coherence and is easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any microservice THEN it SHALL follow the same hexagonal architecture patterns and package structure
2. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL be able to understand the architecture by examining any service
3. WHEN adding new services THEN they SHALL follow the established hexagonal architecture template

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection configuration, so that the hexagonal architecture is properly wired and dependencies flow in the correct direction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN dependencies SHALL flow from adapters toward the domain core
2. WHEN configuring Spring beans THEN the domain SHALL not depend on Spring annotations or framework-specific code
3. WHEN wiring components THEN the configuration SHALL be centralized and clearly define the adapter-port relationships

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing strategies that leverage the hexagonal architecture, so that I can test each layer independently and ensure proper integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN domain logic SHALL be testable in isolation using test doubles for ports
2. WHEN writing integration tests THEN adapters SHALL be testable independently of the domain logic
3. WHEN writing end-to-end tests THEN the full hexagonal architecture SHALL be validated with real implementations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples of the hexagonal architecture implementation, so that I can understand and maintain the architectural patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be clear documentation explaining the hexagonal architecture implementation
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN there SHALL be examples and templates showing how to follow the architectural patterns
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the architecture documentation SHALL provide guidance on layer responsibilities and boundaries
