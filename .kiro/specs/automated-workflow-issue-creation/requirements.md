# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement an automated system that creates GitHub issues whenever CI/CD workflows fail. The system will analyze workflow failures, extract relevant information, and create detailed issues that can be assigned to developers for resolution. This will improve incident response time and ensure no workflow failures go unnoticed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want GitHub issues to be automatically created when any workflow fails, so that failures are tracked and can be assigned to developers for resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any GitHub Actions workflow fails THEN the system SHALL automatically create a GitHub issue
2. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN the system SHALL include the workflow name, failure reason, and relevant logs
3. WHEN multiple jobs in a workflow fail THEN the system SHALL create a single consolidated issue with all failure details
4. WHEN the same workflow fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL update the existing issue instead of creating duplicates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want workflow failure issues to contain comprehensive diagnostic information, so that I can quickly understand and fix the problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL include the failed job names and step details
2. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL include relevant error messages and stack traces
3. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL include links to the failed workflow run
4. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL include the commit SHA and branch information
5. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL include suggested troubleshooting steps based on the failure type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want workflow failure issues to be properly categorized and labeled, so that they can be efficiently triaged and assigned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL be labeled with "workflow-failure" and the workflow type
2. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL be assigned appropriate priority based on the workflow criticality
3. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL include relevant component labels based on the failed workflow
4. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN it SHALL be assigned to the appropriate team or individual based on workflow ownership

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the system to avoid creating duplicate issues for the same workflow failure, so that we don't get overwhelmed with redundant notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow fails and an open issue already exists for the same workflow THEN the system SHALL update the existing issue
2. WHEN updating an existing workflow failure issue THEN the system SHALL add the new failure details as a comment
3. WHEN a workflow failure issue is resolved and the workflow fails again THEN the system SHALL create a new issue
4. WHEN checking for duplicate issues THEN the system SHALL search by workflow name and failure type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which workflows trigger automatic issue creation, so that I can control the noise level and focus on critical failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to specify which workflows should trigger issue creation
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to set different priority levels for different workflow types
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to define custom issue templates for specific workflows
4. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to specify default assignees for different workflow categories

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want workflow failure issues to include actionable next steps, so that I can quickly resolve the problem without extensive investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a linting workflow fails THEN the issue SHALL include links to linting configuration and common fixes
2. WHEN a build workflow fails THEN the issue SHALL include build logs and dependency information
3. WHEN a test workflow fails THEN the issue SHALL include test results and failure patterns
4. WHEN a deployment workflow fails THEN the issue SHALL include environment status and rollback procedures
5. WHEN any workflow fails THEN the issue SHALL include a checklist of common troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want workflow failure notifications to integrate with our existing notification systems, so that the team is immediately aware of critical failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a critical workflow fails THEN the system SHALL send notifications to configured Slack channels or email lists
2. WHEN a workflow failure issue is created THEN the system SHALL mention relevant team members based on the workflow type
3. WHEN multiple workflows fail within a short timeframe THEN the system SHALL escalate notifications to senior team members
4. WHEN a workflow has been failing repeatedly THEN the system SHALL send escalated notifications to project maintainers
