# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will modernize the authentication and authorization system for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services SaaS application. The current system has several issues including outdated JWT implementation, inconsistent RBAC patterns, and lack of modern security standards. This modernization will implement industry-standard frameworks and patterns for 2025, including Spring Security 6.x best practices, OAuth2/OIDC integration, fine-grained RBAC, and multi-tenant security isolation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to upgrade to modern JWT implementation so that the system uses current security standards and eliminates deprecated JJWT methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are generated THEN they SHALL use the latest JJWT 0.12.x API with proper builder patterns
2. WHEN tokens are validated THEN the system SHALL use modern JWT parser methods without deprecated APIs
3. WHEN JWT secrets are managed THEN they SHALL use proper key rotation and secure storage mechanisms
4. WHEN JWT claims are processed THEN they SHALL follow RFC 7519 standards with proper validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement Spring Authorization Server so that the system provides enterprise-grade OAuth2/OIDC capabilities with proper token management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth2 authorization is needed THEN the system SHALL use Spring Authorization Server 1.2.x
2. WHEN OIDC discovery is requested THEN the system SHALL provide proper metadata endpoints
3. WHEN client credentials are managed THEN they SHALL support PKCE and proper client authentication
4. WHEN token introspection is needed THEN the system SHALL provide RFC 7662 compliant endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fine-grained RBAC with attribute-based access control so that permissions can be managed at resource and action levels with contextual attributes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permissions are evaluated THEN the system SHALL support resource-based permissions (e.g., debate:123:edit)
2. WHEN access decisions are made THEN they SHALL consider user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental context
3. WHEN roles are assigned THEN they SHALL support hierarchical role inheritance and delegation
4. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL use Spring Security's @PreAuthorize with SpEL expressions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SaaS operator, I want proper multi-tenant security isolation so that organizations cannot access each other's data or resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL enforce organization-level data isolation
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL automatically include tenant filtering
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL validate organization membership and permissions
4. WHEN cross-tenant access is attempted THEN it SHALL be blocked with proper audit logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive security audit logging so that all authentication and authorization events are tracked for compliance and security monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with user, timestamp, IP, and outcome
2. WHEN authorization decisions are made THEN they SHALL be logged with user, resource, action, and decision
3. WHEN security violations occur THEN they SHALL trigger alerts and be logged with high priority
4. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN they SHALL be tamper-evident and stored securely

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want modern password policies and MFA support so that user accounts are protected with current security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are created THEN they SHALL meet NIST 800-63B guidelines for complexity and length
2. WHEN MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL support TOTP, SMS, and hardware tokens
3. WHEN account lockout occurs THEN it SHALL follow progressive delay patterns to prevent brute force
4. WHEN password breaches are detected THEN users SHALL be notified and required to change passwords

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want standardized security configuration so that all microservices use consistent security patterns and can be easily maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are configured THEN they SHALL use shared security configuration from MCP-common
2. WHEN security filters are applied THEN they SHALL follow consistent ordering and patterns
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL use centralized and environment-specific settings
4. WHEN security headers are set THEN they SHALL include modern security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want externalized security configuration so that security settings can be managed through configuration management without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security settings are changed THEN they SHALL be configurable through environment variables
2. WHEN different environments are deployed THEN they SHALL use appropriate security configurations
3. WHEN secrets are managed THEN they SHALL be stored in secure configuration management systems
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN services SHALL support dynamic refresh without restarts
