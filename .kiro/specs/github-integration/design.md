# GitHub Integration Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for integrating Kiro with GitHub, enabling automated code reviews, suggestions, and fixes when pull requests are assigned to Kiro. The integration leverages GitHub's API and webhook system to seamlessly incorporate Kiro's AI capabilities into the development workflow, providing intelligent feedback on code changes directly within the GitHub interface.

The system will be implemented as a GitHub App that can be installed on repositories, with configurable permissions and settings to adapt to different team workflows and requirements.

### Component Interaction Flow

1. A developer assigns a PR to Kiro on GitHub
2. GitHub sends a webhook event to the Kiro Integration Service
3. The Webhook Handler processes the event and authenticates with GitHub
4. The PR Processor retrieves PR details and code changes
5. The Code Analyzer evaluates the changes using the Kiro AI Engine
6. The Comment Generator creates meaningful feedback
7. The Fix Suggester identifies issues that can be automatically fixed
8. Comments and suggestions are posted back to GitHub via the API
9. Analytics and feedback are stored for future learning

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. GitHub App Configuration

The integration will be implemented as a GitHub App with the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull_requests: write    # Comment on PRs, read PR content
  contents: write         # Read repository code, create fix commits
  issues: read           # Read linked issues for context
  metadata: read         # Access repository metadata
  workflows: read        # Understand CI/CD context
```

Installation flow:
1. Repository admin installs the Kiro GitHub App
2. OAuth authorization for user-specific actions
3. Configuration wizard for repository-specific settings
4. Validation of permissions and access

### 2. Webhook Handler

Endpoints:
- `/webhooks/github`: Receives GitHub events
- `/webhooks/status`: Webhook health check

Event types processed:
- `pull_request.assigned`: When Kiro is assigned as reviewer
- `pull_request.review_requested`: When Kiro is requested as reviewer
- `issue_comment.created`: When Kiro is mentioned in comments
- `pull_request.synchronize`: When new commits are pushed to a PR under review

Security measures:
- Webhook secret validation
- Payload signature verification
- Rate limiting
- IP allowlisting

### 3. Authentication Manager

Authentication methods:
- GitHub App installation tokens
- User OAuth tokens for user-context actions
- JWT for service-to-service communication

Token management:
- Secure storage with encryption
- Automatic token rotation
- Permission scoping
- Audit logging

### 4. PR Processor

Responsibilities:

## Error Handling

### GitHub API Errors

- Rate limiting: Implement exponential backoff and request queuing
- Authentication failures: Automatic token refresh and notification
- Permission issues: Clear error messages with remediation steps
- Network failures: Retry mechanism with circuit breaker pattern

### Processing Errors

- Large PR handling: Chunking and incremental processing
- Timeout management: Background processing with status updates
- Resource constraints: Queue prioritization and resource allocation
- Parsing failures: Graceful degradation to partial analysis

### User Feedback Errors

- Comment posting failures: Local caching and retry
- Suggestion application errors: Detailed error reporting
- Configuration validation: Immediate feedback on invalid settings
- Integration failures: Self-diagnostic tools and logs

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Code content: Processed in secure environments with encryption
- Credentials: Encrypted storage with access controls
- User data: Minimal collection with proper retention policies
- Analytics: Anonymization for aggregate reporting

### Access Control

- Repository-level permissions: Granular access based on GitHub roles
- User authentication: OAuth flow with limited scopes
- Admin functions: Role-based access control
- API security: Token-based authentication with short lifetimes

### Compliance

- Audit logging: Comprehensive activity tracking
- Data residency: Configurable processing locations
- Retention policies: Configurable data retention periods
- Transparency: Clear documentation of data usage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Component isolation: Mock external dependencies
- Behavior verification: Test expected outputs for known inputs
- Error handling: Verify graceful handling of failure cases
- Security validation: Test permission boundaries

### Integration Testing

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling: Stateless components for easy replication
- Queue-based processing: Decouple event reception from processing
- Caching strategy: Repository structure and context caching
- Resource allocation: Dynamic resource allocation based on workload

### Optimization

- Large repository handling: Incremental analysis and caching
- PR size management: Chunking of large PRs for parallel processing
- Response time targets: < 5 minutes for small PRs, < 15 minutes for medium PRs
- Background processing: Non-blocking operations with status updates

### Monitoring
