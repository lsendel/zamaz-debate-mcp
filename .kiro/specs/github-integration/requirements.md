# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing GitHub integration with Kiro, allowing users to assign pull requests to Kiro for automated code review, suggestions, and potentially automated fixes. This integration will enhance developer productivity by leveraging Kiro's AI capabilities directly within the GitHub workflow, providing intelligent feedback on code changes without requiring context switching to a separate application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to assign pull requests to Kiro, so that I can receive automated code reviews and suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer assigns a pull request to "Kiro" THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a code review process
2. WHEN Kiro is assigned to a PR THEN the system SHALL analyze the code changes in the pull request
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide comments on code quality, potential bugs, and improvement suggestions
4. WHEN Kiro detects issues THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, major, minor)
5. IF the PR contains security vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL highlight them with high priority

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want Kiro to enforce coding standards and best practices in PRs, so that code quality remains consistent across the team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro reviews a PR THEN the system SHALL check compliance with the team's coding standards
2. WHEN style violations are found THEN the system SHALL suggest specific fixes with code examples
3. WHEN best practices are not followed THEN the system SHALL provide educational comments explaining the recommended approach
4. WHEN the PR passes all checks THEN the system SHALL add an approval comment
5. IF the repository has a custom ruleset THEN the system SHALL use those rules for evaluation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure Kiro's GitHub integration settings, so that it works according to our team's workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for PR assignment triggers
2. WHEN configuring the integration THEN the system SHALL allow customization of review depth and focus areas
3. WHEN integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL authenticate securely with GitHub using OAuth or GitHub Apps
4. WHEN multiple repositories need integration THEN the system SHALL support batch configuration
5. IF configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring redeployment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to suggest automated fixes for issues it identifies, so that I can apply them with minimal effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro identifies fixable issues THEN the system SHALL suggest specific code changes
2. WHEN automated fixes are available THEN the system SHALL provide a way to apply them directly from GitHub
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL create a new commit in the PR branch
4. WHEN multiple fixes are available THEN the system SHALL allow selecting which ones to apply
5. IF automated fixes might change behavior THEN the system SHALL clearly mark them for manual review

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see analytics on Kiro's GitHub activity, so that I can measure its impact on development efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro performs reviews THEN the system SHALL track metrics like response time and issues found
2. WHEN reviews are completed THEN the system SHALL record what percentage of suggestions were accepted
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing trends over time
4. WHEN analyzing team performance THEN the system SHALL provide insights on common issues across PRs
5. IF integration is used across multiple repositories THEN the system SHALL allow comparing metrics between them

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to understand the context of my PR by analyzing related issues and documentation, so that its suggestions are more relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro reviews a PR THEN the system SHALL check for linked GitHub issues
2. WHEN linked issues exist THEN the system SHALL incorporate their context into the review
3. WHEN project documentation is available THEN the system SHALL reference relevant sections in its comments
4. WHEN the PR description contains specific instructions THEN the system SHALL prioritize those areas
5. IF the PR is part of a larger feature THEN the system SHALL consider the broader implementation context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control access permissions for the Kiro GitHub integration, so that I can ensure security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the system SHALL request minimal required permissions
2. WHEN users interact with Kiro THEN the system SHALL respect GitHub's permission model
3. WHEN sensitive code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL ensure data doesn't leave approved boundaries
4. WHEN authentication tokens need rotation THEN the system SHALL provide a secure mechanism
5. IF security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL have a clear revocation process

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to learn from my feedback on its PR comments, so that it improves over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers respond to Kiro's comments THEN the system SHALL analyze the feedback
2. WHEN suggestions are rejected THEN the system SHALL record the reasoning when provided
3. WHEN patterns emerge in accepted vs. rejected suggestions THEN the system SHALL adapt its future recommendations
4. WHEN reviewing code from the same developer THEN the system SHALL consider their historical preferences
5. IF team practices evolve THEN the system SHALL adjust to new patterns without explicit reconfiguration
