# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services project. Building upon the comprehensive CI/CD foundation already in place, this enhancement focuses on performance optimization, reliability improvements, and enhanced developer experience while leveraging the existing GitHub Actions infrastructure and security-first approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want faster CI/CD pipeline execution with intelligent caching and parallel processing, so that I can get quicker feedback on my code changes and deploy more frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the CI pipeline SHALL complete basic validation within 5 minutes for PRs
2. WHEN Maven builds are executed THEN the system SHALL use advanced caching to reduce build times by 30%
3. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL leverage layer caching and parallel builds to improve performance
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run only affected tests for PR validation
5. IF full validation is needed THEN the system SHALL support on-demand full pipeline execution via labels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want enhanced deployment strategies with automated monitoring and rollback capabilities, so that deployments are more reliable and can recover automatically from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to staging THEN the system SHALL use blue-green deployment with automated health monitoring
2. WHEN health checks fail during deployment THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger rollback procedures
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL implement canary deployment for gradual rollout
4. WHEN deployment metrics exceed error thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to previous version
5. IF manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear rollback procedures and monitoring dashboards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want comprehensive pipeline performance monitoring and DORA metrics tracking, so that I can identify bottlenecks and measure team productivity improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipelines execute THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on build duration, success rate, and resource usage
2. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL track deployment frequency, lead time, and change failure rate
3. WHEN failures happen THEN the system SHALL measure and report mean time to recovery (MTTR)
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards and automated alerting for anomalies
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent change detection and affected module testing, so that I only run necessary tests and builds for my changes, reducing feedback time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PR is created THEN the system SHALL detect which modules are affected by the changes
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute only tests related to changed modules for fast feedback
3. WHEN building artifacts THEN the system SHALL build only affected modules unless full build is requested
4. WHEN security scans run THEN the system SHALL perform incremental scanning for changed components
5. IF comprehensive validation is needed THEN the system SHALL support full pipeline execution on demand

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want enhanced security scanning with supply chain attestation and runtime monitoring, so that we maintain security compliance while improving pipeline performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN artifacts are built THEN the system SHALL generate and sign Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
2. WHEN container images are created THEN the system SHALL implement provenance tracking and attestation
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL verify signatures and check for supply chain attacks
4. WHEN applications run THEN the system SHALL monitor for runtime security anomalies
5. IF security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically quarantine affected components and alert security team

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced PR preview environments and automated code review assistance, so that I can validate changes in production-like conditions and receive intelligent feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PR is created THEN the system SHALL optionally create preview environments for testing
2. WHEN code is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide automated code review suggestions and quality feedback
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent failure analysis and suggested fixes
4. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically flag and provide comparison data
5. IF code quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations and auto-fix suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want cost optimization and resource efficiency monitoring, so that we can reduce CI/CD operational costs while maintaining performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipelines execute THEN the system SHALL track and report resource usage and costs
2. WHEN runners are allocated THEN the system SHALL optimize runner selection based on workload requirements
3. WHEN caching is used THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cache management with cleanup policies
4. WHEN builds run THEN the system SHALL use parallel execution and resource pooling for efficiency
5. IF costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations and automated cost controls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced local development integration with CI/CD pipeline, so that I can replicate CI conditions locally and debug pipeline issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide tools to run CI checks locally before pushing
2. WHEN pipeline failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and reproduction steps
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support remote debugging of pipeline issues
4. WHEN environment setup is required THEN the system SHALL provide automated local environment replication
5. IF pipeline configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate changes locally before deployment

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and compliance reporting for all CI/CD activities, so that we can meet regulatory requirements and track all changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any pipeline action occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed audit information with timestamps and actors
2. WHEN deployments happen THEN the system SHALL record approval chains, deployment artifacts, and environment states
3. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports with findings and remediation status
4. WHEN rollbacks occur THEN the system SHALL document reasons, impact assessment, and recovery procedures
5. IF audit queries are made THEN the system SHALL provide searchable logs with retention policies and export capabilities

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a development team, I want AI-powered pipeline optimization and predictive failure analysis, so that we can proactively prevent issues and continuously improve our development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL use ML to predict and prevent flaky test failures
2. WHEN deployments are planned THEN the system SHALL assess risk and recommend optimal deployment timing
3. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent root cause analysis and suggested fixes
4. WHEN performance patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend optimization strategies
5. IF anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL proactively alert teams and suggest preventive actions
