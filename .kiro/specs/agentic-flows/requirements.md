# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Zamaz Debate MCP Services with advanced agentic flows. The system will support multiple reasoning and decision-making patterns for AI agents, including Internal Monologue, Self-Critique Loop, Multi-Agent Red-Team, Tool-Calling Verification, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Re-ranking. These enhancements will provide more sophisticated, accurate, and transparent AI debate capabilities, allowing for better reasoning, fact-checking, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Internal Monologue (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)

4. WHEN a debate is configured THEN the system SHALL allow moderators to enable or disable the visibility of internal monologues to other participants
5. WHEN an AI agent completes its internal reasoning THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between the reasoning process and the final answer
6. WHEN analyzing debate performance THEN the system SHALL track and report on how internal monologue affects response quality and accuracy

### Requirement 2: Self-Critique Loop
