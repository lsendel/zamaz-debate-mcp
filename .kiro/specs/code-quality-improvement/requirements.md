# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving code quality across the Zamaz Debate MCP Services system through enhanced readability, better naming conventions, implementation of best practices, and increased code reuse. The goal is to create a more maintainable, consistent, and developer-friendly codebase that follows industry standards and reduces technical debt.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the MCP services, I want consistent and clear naming conventions across all services, so that I can quickly understand code structure and purpose without extensive documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Java classes THEN all classes SHALL follow consistent naming patterns (Controllers end with "Controller", Services with "Service", etc.)
2. WHEN examining method names THEN they SHALL use descriptive verbs that clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., "createDebate" instead of "create")
3. WHEN looking at variable names THEN they SHALL use meaningful nouns that describe their content (e.g., "debateParticipants" instead of "list")
4. WHEN reviewing database entities THEN field names SHALL follow snake_case convention consistently
5. WHEN examining API endpoints THEN they SHALL follow RESTful naming conventions with consistent resource naming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want shared utility functions and common patterns extracted into reusable components, so that I can reduce code duplication and ensure consistent behavior across services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining service implementations THEN common patterns SHALL be extracted into shared utility classes in mcp-common
2. WHEN reviewing API clients THEN shared HTTP client configuration SHALL be centralized in a base client class
3. WHEN looking at validation logic THEN common validation rules SHALL be implemented as reusable validators
4. WHEN examining exception handling THEN common error handling patterns SHALL be standardized across all services
5. WHEN reviewing database operations THEN common repository patterns SHALL be abstracted into base repository classes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer reading the code, I want improved code structure and documentation, so that I can understand business logic and system behavior without needing to trace through multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining service classes THEN they SHALL have clear separation of concerns with single responsibility
2. WHEN reviewing method implementations THEN complex business logic SHALL be broken down into smaller, well-named private methods
3. WHEN looking at class documentation THEN all public APIs SHALL have comprehensive JavaDoc comments
4. WHEN examining configuration classes THEN they SHALL have clear comments explaining their purpose and usage
5. WHEN reviewing complex algorithms THEN they SHALL include inline comments explaining the logic flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the frontend, I want consistent React component patterns and TypeScript usage, so that I can maintain and extend the UI efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining React components THEN they SHALL follow consistent file naming and component structure patterns
2. WHEN reviewing TypeScript interfaces THEN they SHALL be properly defined with clear property descriptions
3. WHEN looking at Redux slices THEN they SHALL follow consistent action naming and state structure patterns
4. WHEN examining API client code THEN it SHALL have proper error handling and type safety
5. WHEN reviewing component props THEN they SHALL be properly typed with descriptive interface names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing new features, I want standardized architectural patterns and best practices, so that I can build consistent, maintainable code that integrates well with existing services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new controllers THEN they SHALL follow the established controller pattern with proper error handling
2. WHEN creating new services THEN they SHALL implement proper dependency injection and interface segregation
3. WHEN adding new database entities THEN they SHALL follow JPA best practices with proper relationships and constraints
4. WHEN implementing security features THEN they SHALL follow established JWT and authentication patterns
5. WHEN adding new API endpoints THEN they SHALL include proper OpenAPI documentation and validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want improved logging and error handling, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate context and stack traces
2. WHEN examining log messages THEN they SHALL include relevant business context and correlation IDs
3. WHEN handling exceptions THEN they SHALL be properly categorized and include actionable error messages
4. WHEN reviewing service interactions THEN they SHALL include request/response logging for debugging
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN logs SHALL include performance metrics and timing information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working on tests, I want consistent testing patterns and improved test coverage, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and structure patterns
2. WHEN creating integration tests THEN they SHALL use proper test containers and mock configurations
3. WHEN examining test coverage THEN critical business logic SHALL have comprehensive test coverage
4. WHEN reviewing test data THEN it SHALL be properly organized and reusable across test suites
5. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute reliably and provide clear failure messages
