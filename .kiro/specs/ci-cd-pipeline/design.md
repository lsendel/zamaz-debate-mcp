# CI/CD Pipeline Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services project. The pipeline will build upon existing GitHub Actions workflows and extend them to provide full automation from code commit to production deployment.

The system consists of multiple Java Spring Boot microservices (mcp-organization, mcp-controller, mcp-llm, mcp-rag, mcp-template), a React TypeScript frontend, and supporting infrastructure. The CI/CD pipeline will provide automated testing, security scanning, building, and deployment across multiple environments.

### Multi-Environment Strategy

The pipeline supports three primary environments:

1. **Development Environment**: Local development with Docker Compose
2. **Staging Environment**: Production-like environment for testing
3. **Production Environment**: Live system serving end users

### Branching Strategy

- **Feature Branches**: Trigger CI pipeline with quality gates
- **Develop Branch**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- **Main Branch**: Manual approval required for production deployment

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Primary CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
```yaml
# Triggers: Push to any branch, PR to main/develop
# Responsibilities:
# - Code quality checks (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, SonarQube)
# - Unit and integration tests
# - Security scanning
# - Docker image building
# - Artifact publishing
```

#### Staging Deployment Workflow (`deploy-staging.yml`)
```yaml
# Triggers: Push to develop branch
# Responsibilities:
# - Deploy to staging environment
# - Run smoke tests
# - Update deployment status
```

#### Production Deployment Workflow (`deploy-production.yml`)
```yaml
# Triggers: Manual approval after main branch CI passes
# Responsibilities:
# - Blue-green or canary deployment
# - Production health monitoring
# - Automatic rollback on failure
```

#### Security Scanning Workflow (Enhanced)
```yaml
# Extends existing security.yml
# Additional responsibilities:
# - Container image vulnerability scanning
# - Infrastructure as Code security checks
# - Compliance reporting
```

### 2. Build System Integration

#### Maven Multi-Module Build
- Parallel module building for performance
- Dependency caching between builds
- Test result aggregation
- Code coverage reporting

#### Docker Multi-Stage Builds
- Optimized layer caching
- Security-hardened base images
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal runtime images

### 3. Container Registry Management

#### Image Tagging Strategy
```
registry.example.com/zamaz-mcp/{service}:{tag}

Tag formats:
- {commit-sha} - Exact commit reference
- {branch-name}-{build-number} - Branch builds
- {semantic-version} - Release versions
- latest - Latest stable release
```

#### Registry Security
- Vulnerability scanning on push
- Image signing with Cosign
- Access control with RBAC
- Retention policies for cleanup

### 4. Deployment Orchestration

#### Staging Environment
- Docker Compose based deployment
- Automated database migrations
- Configuration management via environment variables
- Health check validation

#### Production Environment
- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm deployment
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for critical updates
- Automatic scaling based on metrics

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

#### Application Monitoring
- Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Custom business metrics

#### Pipeline Monitoring
- Build success/failure rates
- Deployment frequency metrics
- Lead time tracking
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## Data Models

### Pipeline Configuration Model

pipeline:
  environments:
    - name: staging
      auto_deploy: true
      approval_required: false
