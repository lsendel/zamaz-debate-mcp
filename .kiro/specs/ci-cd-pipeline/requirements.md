# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services project. The system consists of multiple Java Spring Boot microservices, a React TypeScript frontend, and supporting infrastructure components. The CI/CD pipeline will automate testing, building, security scanning, and deployment processes across multiple environments while ensuring high code quality and system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and building triggered on every code push, so that I can quickly identify issues and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code to any branch THEN the CI system SHALL trigger automated builds and tests
2. WHEN the build process starts THEN the system SHALL run unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify the development team
4. WHEN code quality metrics fall below thresholds THEN the system SHALL block the pipeline and provide detailed reports
5. IF the branch is main or develop THEN the system SHALL also run security scans and dependency vulnerability checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated Docker image building and registry management, so that deployments are consistent and traceable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds pass all quality gates THEN the system SHALL build Docker images for all services
2. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL tag them with commit SHA, branch name, and semantic version
3. WHEN images are successfully built THEN the system SHALL push them to the container registry
4. WHEN pushing to registry THEN the system SHALL scan images for security vulnerabilities
5. IF vulnerability scan fails THEN the system SHALL prevent image promotion and alert security team

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated deployment to staging environments, so that we can test features in production-like conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to develop branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
2. WHEN deploying to staging THEN the system SHALL run database migrations and configuration updates
3. WHEN staging deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests and health checks
4. WHEN smoke tests pass THEN the system SHALL notify the team that staging is ready for testing
5. IF deployment or tests fail THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous stable version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want controlled production deployments with approval gates, so that releases are stable and business-critical.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to main branch THEN the system SHALL create a release candidate
2. WHEN release candidate is created THEN the system SHALL require manual approval for production deployment
3. WHEN production deployment is approved THEN the system SHALL deploy using blue-green or canary strategy
4. WHEN production deployment starts THEN the system SHALL monitor key metrics and health indicators
5. IF production metrics indicate issues THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback the deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive security scanning integrated into the pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are caught before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL scan for secrets and sensitive data
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL check for known vulnerabilities
3. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL scan container images for security issues
4. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed security reports
5. IF critical security issues are found THEN the system SHALL block deployment and create security tickets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can quickly respond to build and deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline stages execute THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on build times, success rates, and failure patterns
2. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL monitor application health and performance metrics
3. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications via Slack, email, and dashboard alerts
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger automated scaling or rollback procedures
5. IF critical services fail THEN the system SHALL immediately alert on-call engineers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit trails and deployment tracking, so that we can meet regulatory requirements and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any pipeline action occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed audit information
2. WHEN deployments happen THEN the system SHALL record who deployed what version when and where
3. WHEN rollbacks occur THEN the system SHALL document the reason and impact
4. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide deployment history and change tracking
5. IF audit queries are made THEN the system SHALL provide searchable logs with retention policies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration management, so that services run correctly across different deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL apply environment-specific configurations
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate configuration syntax and required values
3. WHEN secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL securely inject them from vault systems
4. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL restart affected services gracefully
5. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and report specific errors
