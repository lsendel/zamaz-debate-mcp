# E2E Testing Improvement Requirements

## Introduction

The current E2E testing framework for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services needs significant improvements to enhance clarity, usability, and adherence to industry best practices. The existing tests have several issues including poor error handling, inconsistent patterns, limited coverage, and inadequate reporting mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Framework Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern, well-structured E2E testing framework so that I can write reliable tests efficiently and maintain them easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test framework is updated THEN it SHALL use TypeScript with strict typing throughout
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the framework SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture comprehensive debugging information automatically
4. WHEN new tests are written THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and conventions
5. IF a test encounters an error THEN the framework SHALL provide stack traces with source maps
6. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute in a predictable, deterministic order

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Test Organization and Structure

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want tests organized in a logical, scalable structure so that I can easily find, understand, and maintain test cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped by feature area with clear naming conventions
2. WHEN test suites are created THEN they SHALL have proper setup and teardown procedures
3. WHEN tests share common functionality THEN they SHALL use reusable page objects and utilities
4. WHEN test data is needed THEN it SHALL be managed through centralized test data factories
5. IF tests require specific configurations THEN they SHALL be isolated and configurable per environment
6. WHEN tests are documented THEN they SHALL include clear descriptions and acceptance criteria

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want comprehensive test coverage across all critical user journeys so that I can be confident in the system's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authentication flows are tested THEN they SHALL cover login, logout, session management, and error scenarios
2. WHEN debate functionality is tested THEN it SHALL cover creation, participation, real-time updates, and completion flows
3. WHEN API integrations are tested THEN they SHALL verify request/response patterns, error handling, and data consistency
4. WHEN UI components are tested THEN they SHALL verify accessibility, responsiveness, and user interactions
5. IF agentic flows are configured THEN tests SHALL verify their integration and functionality
6. WHEN performance is tested THEN it SHALL measure load times, API response times, and resource usage

### Requirement 4: Advanced Debugging and Evidence Collection

**User Story:** As a developer debugging test failures, I want comprehensive evidence collection so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL automatically capture screenshots, videos, and browser logs
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response data with timing information
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are used THEN the system SHALL capture message flows and connection states
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL capture Lighthouse reports and resource usage
5. IF database state is relevant THEN the system SHALL capture snapshots before and after test execution
6. WHEN evidence is collected THEN it SHALL be organized in a structured, searchable format

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline maintainer, I want tests that handle errors gracefully and provide clear failure reasons so that build failures can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN tests SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN UI elements are not immediately available THEN tests SHALL use intelligent waiting strategies
3. WHEN test environments are unstable THEN the framework SHALL detect and handle transient failures
4. WHEN tests encounter unexpected states THEN they SHALL capture context and fail with descriptive messages
5. IF services are unavailable THEN tests SHALL skip gracefully with appropriate notifications
6. WHEN flaky tests are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for investigation

### Requirement 6: Performance and Load Testing Integration

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want E2E tests that include performance validation so that performance regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN tests SHALL verify load times meet performance budgets
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN tests SHALL validate response times are within acceptable limits
3. WHEN real-time features are used THEN tests SHALL measure WebSocket latency and throughput
4. WHEN multiple users interact THEN tests SHALL simulate concurrent usage patterns
5. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN tests SHALL fail with detailed performance reports
6. WHEN performance data is collected THEN it SHALL be tracked over time for trend analysis

### Requirement 7: Cross-Browser and Device Testing

**User Story:** As a QA lead, I want tests that verify functionality across different browsers and devices so that users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL run on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers
2. WHEN mobile compatibility is tested THEN tests SHALL verify responsive design and touch interactions
3. WHEN accessibility is validated THEN tests SHALL check WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility
4. WHEN different viewport sizes are tested THEN UI SHALL adapt appropriately
5. IF browser-specific issues are found THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and tracked
6. WHEN cross-browser results differ THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies

### Requirement 8: Continuous Integration and Reporting

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated test execution with comprehensive reporting so that team productivity and quality metrics are visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN they SHALL integrate with build pipelines and provide status updates
2. WHEN test results are generated THEN they SHALL include pass/fail rates, trends, and performance metrics
3. WHEN tests complete THEN reports SHALL be automatically distributed to relevant stakeholders
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN notifications SHALL be sent with failure details and remediation steps
5. IF test coverage changes THEN reports SHALL highlight coverage improvements or regressions
6. WHEN historical data is available THEN dashboards SHALL show quality trends over time

### Requirement 9: Test Data Management and Isolation

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want reliable test data management so that tests are independent and can run in parallel without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require data THEN they SHALL use factories to generate consistent, isolated test data
2. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's data
3. WHEN test environments are shared THEN data SHALL be properly namespaced and cleaned up
4. WHEN sensitive data is used THEN it SHALL be properly masked in logs and reports
5. IF test data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL detect and refresh it automatically
6. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL clean up created data unless explicitly preserved for debugging

### Requirement 10: API and Integration Testing Enhancement

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want comprehensive API testing integrated with E2E tests so that service integrations are thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN they SHALL verify request/response schemas and data types
2. WHEN service integrations are tested THEN they SHALL validate end-to-end data flow
3. WHEN error conditions occur THEN API tests SHALL verify proper error responses and handling
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN tests SHALL verify token management and security
5. IF rate limiting is implemented THEN tests SHALL verify limits are enforced correctly
6. WHEN API versions change THEN tests SHALL validate backward compatibility
