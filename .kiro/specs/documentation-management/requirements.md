# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive documentation management system for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services platform. The system will serve as a centralized hub for project and subproject documentation, integrated with the MCP-rag service for intelligent content retrieval and generation. The solution is designed as a SaaS offering supporting multiple applications and organizations with proper tenant isolation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage documentation across multiple tenant organizations, so that each organization has isolated access to their documentation while maintaining system-wide efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization is created THEN the system SHALL provision a dedicated documentation workspace with proper tenant isolation
2. WHEN a user accesses documentation THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant-based access controls ensuring users only see their organization's content
3. IF a user attempts to access documentation from another tenant THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the security event
4. WHEN documentation is stored THEN the system SHALL tag it with the appropriate tenant identifier for proper isolation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to organize documentation hierarchically by projects and subprojects, so that team members can easily navigate and find relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL allow hierarchical organization with unlimited nesting levels
2. WHEN a user browses documentation THEN the system SHALL display a tree-like navigation structure showing projects and subprojects
3. WHEN moving documentation between projects THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and update all cross-references
4. WHEN deleting a project THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and handle cascading deletion of subprojects and associated documentation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate documentation with the MCP-rag service, so that I can leverage AI-powered content generation, summarization, and intelligent search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically index it in the MCP-rag service for vector-based search
2. WHEN a user searches for documentation THEN the system SHALL provide both traditional keyword search and semantic search via MCP-rag
3. WHEN generating documentation summaries THEN the system SHALL use MCP-rag to create intelligent abstracts and key point extractions
4. WHEN suggesting related content THEN the system SHALL leverage MCP-rag's similarity matching to recommend relevant documentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create, edit, and version documentation with rich formatting capabilities, so that I can produce professional-quality documentation with proper change tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL support Markdown editing with live preview capabilities
2. WHEN editing documentation THEN the system SHALL automatically save drafts and provide version history
3. WHEN publishing documentation THEN the system SHALL create immutable versions with timestamps and author information
4. WHEN collaborating on documentation THEN the system SHALL support concurrent editing with conflict resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to expose documentation management through MCP tools and resources, so that external applications can programmatically interact with the documentation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external applications connect via MCP THEN the system SHALL provide tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documentation
2. WHEN MCP clients request documentation resources THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted content with metadata
3. WHEN performing bulk operations via MCP THEN the system SHALL support batch processing with proper error handling
4. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL provide webhook notifications for documentation changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a SaaS platform operator, I want to support multiple applications per tenant with proper resource isolation, so that organizations can manage documentation for different products or services independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant creates multiple applications THEN the system SHALL provide separate documentation spaces for each application
2. WHEN users switch between applications THEN the system SHALL maintain context and show only relevant documentation
3. WHEN billing for usage THEN the system SHALL track storage and API usage per tenant and application
4. WHEN scaling resources THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with proper data partitioning

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive access control and audit logging, so that I can ensure proper security governance and compliance tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access documentation THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control with granular permissions
2. WHEN documentation is modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with user identity, timestamp, and change details
3. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and maintain audit trails for compliance reporting
4. WHEN integrating with external authentication THEN the system SHALL support SSO and maintain session security

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful APIs with proper documentation and rate limiting, so that I can integrate the documentation system with external tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI specification with comprehensive endpoint documentation
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting per tenant and API key
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with helpful error messages
4. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL support pagination, filtering, and sorting for large datasets
