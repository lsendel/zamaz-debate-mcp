# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive linting across all projects in the Zamaz Debate MCP Services ecosystem. The linter will provide consistent code quality, style enforcement, and automated checks for Java services, React frontend, configuration files, and documentation. It will integrate with the existing build pipeline and provide both local development feedback and CI/CD integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks across all project types, so that I can maintain consistent code standards and catch issues early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the linter locally THEN the system SHALL check Java code using Checkstyle, SpotBugs, and PMD
2. WHEN a developer runs the linter locally THEN the system SHALL check TypeScript/React code using ESLint and Prettier
3. WHEN a developer runs the linter locally THEN the system SHALL check YAML/JSON configuration files for syntax and formatting
4. WHEN a developer runs the linter locally THEN the system SHALL check Markdown documentation for formatting and links
5. WHEN linting errors are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with file locations and suggested fixes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linter to integrate with my IDE and development workflow, so that I can get immediate feedback while coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer saves a file THEN the IDE SHALL display linting errors and warnings inline
2. WHEN a developer commits code THEN the pre-commit hooks SHALL run linting checks automatically
3. WHEN linting fails in pre-commit hooks THEN the commit SHALL be blocked until issues are resolved
4. WHEN auto-fixable issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide an option to automatically fix them
5. IF the developer uses VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide workspace settings for consistent linting configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want linting to be enforced in the CI/CD pipeline, so that code quality standards are maintained across all contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run comprehensive linting checks
2. WHEN linting errors are found in CI THEN the build SHALL fail with detailed error reports
3. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL comment on the PR with linting results
4. WHEN linting passes THEN the system SHALL allow the build to proceed to testing phases
5. IF linting rules are updated THEN the system SHALL apply them consistently across all services

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service-specific linting configurations, so that each project type can have appropriate rules while maintaining overall consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting Java services THEN the system SHALL use Spring Boot and microservice-specific rules
2. WHEN linting the React frontend THEN the system SHALL use React and TypeScript-specific rules
3. WHEN linting configuration files THEN the system SHALL validate Docker, Kubernetes, and Maven configurations
4. WHEN linting documentation THEN the system SHALL check for broken links and consistent formatting
5. IF a service needs custom rules THEN the system SHALL allow service-specific overrides while maintaining base standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive reporting and metrics from linting, so that I can track code quality improvements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports for each project
2. WHEN linting runs in CI THEN the system SHALL publish metrics to monitoring systems
3. WHEN viewing linting reports THEN the system SHALL show trends and quality metrics over time
4. WHEN critical issues are found THEN the system SHALL highlight security and performance concerns
5. IF code quality improves THEN the system SHALL track and report on quality score improvements
