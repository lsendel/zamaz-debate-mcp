# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a centralized configuration management system for the Zamaz Debate MCP Services project. The system will provide unified configuration management across all services and subprojects, enabling dynamic configuration updates, environment-specific settings, and secure configuration distribution. This will improve maintainability, consistency, and operational efficiency across the entire system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Spring Cloud Config Server so that all microservices can retrieve their configuration from a centralized location instead of maintaining individual application.yml files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Spring Cloud Config Server is deployed THEN it SHALL serve configuration files from a Git repository
2. WHEN a microservice starts THEN it SHALL fetch its configuration from the Config Server
3. WHEN configuration files are updated in Git THEN the Config Server SHALL serve the latest version
4. IF the Config Server is unavailable THEN services SHALL fall back to local configuration files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want environment-specific configuration profiles so that the same codebase can run with different settings across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services run in different environments THEN they SHALL load environment-specific configuration profiles
2. WHEN a service requests configuration THEN the Config Server SHALL return the appropriate profile based on the active environment
3. WHEN multiple profiles are active THEN configuration SHALL be merged with proper precedence rules
4. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL override configuration file values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want encrypted configuration properties so that sensitive information like database passwords and API keys are stored securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive properties are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted using Spring Cloud Config encryption
2. WHEN services request encrypted properties THEN the Config Server SHALL decrypt them before serving
3. WHEN encryption keys are managed THEN they SHALL be stored securely and rotated regularly
4. WHEN configuration is transmitted THEN it SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dynamic configuration refresh so that configuration changes can be applied to running services without requiring restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration changes in the Config Server THEN services SHALL be able to refresh their configuration
2. WHEN a refresh is triggered THEN services SHALL reload @ConfigurationProperties and @RefreshScope beans
3. WHEN using Spring Cloud Bus THEN configuration refresh SHALL be broadcast to all service instances
4. WHEN refresh fails THEN services SHALL continue operating with their current configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want configuration versioning and rollback capabilities so that configuration changes can be tracked and reverted if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is stored in Git THEN all changes SHALL be versioned with commit history
2. WHEN configuration needs to be rolled back THEN previous versions SHALL be easily retrievable
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL include descriptive commit messages
4. WHEN multiple developers modify configuration THEN merge conflicts SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want configuration validation so that invalid configuration values are detected before they cause service failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL be validated against defined schemas or constraints
2. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN services SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
3. WHEN configuration types are mismatched THEN validation SHALL catch and report the errors
4. WHEN required properties are missing THEN services SHALL not start and log the missing properties

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared configuration libraries so that common configuration patterns can be reused across all microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need common configuration THEN they SHALL use shared configuration classes from MCP-common
2. WHEN database configuration is needed THEN services SHALL use standardized DataSource configuration
3. WHEN security configuration is required THEN services SHALL use shared JWT and authentication settings
4. WHEN monitoring configuration is needed THEN services SHALL use common actuator and metrics settings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration monitoring and health checks so that configuration-related issues can be detected and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Config Server is running THEN it SHALL expose health check endpoints
2. WHEN services cannot reach the Config Server THEN health checks SHALL report the issue
3. WHEN configuration is successfully loaded THEN services SHALL report configuration health status
4. WHEN configuration refresh fails THEN alerts SHALL be generated for operational teams
