- `/scripts/credential-rotation.sh` - Credential rotation
- `/config-repo/encrypt-value.sh` - Encryption utility

### Documentation
- `/docs/configuration-management-guide.md`
- `/docs/configuration-migration-guide.md`
- `/docs/configuration-troubleshooting-guide.md`
- `/docs/configuration-properties-reference.md`
- `/docs/security-review-checklist.md`

### Infrastructure

- Kubernetes manifests
- Helm charts
- CI/CD workflows

## Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**: All sensitive values use strong encryption
2. **Access Control**: Basic auth and network policies
3. **Audit**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Validation**: Pre-commit hooks and automated scanning
5. **Rotation**: Documented procedures for credential rotation

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Development**: Start with development environment
2. **Team Training**: Conduct training sessions on new configuration system
3. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate services one by one
4. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use metrics to optimize performance
5. **Security Hardening**: Implement additional security measures for production

## Requirements Fulfillment

All 8 requirements have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Centralized Configuration Management** - Spring Cloud Config Server deployed
2. ✅ **Environment-Specific Configurations** - Full profile support implemented
3. ✅ **Secure Credential Storage** - Encryption and security scanning in place
4. ✅ **Dynamic Configuration Updates** - Spring Cloud Bus integration complete
5. ✅ **Version Control Integration** - Git-based with hooks and validation
6. ✅ **Configuration Validation** - Comprehensive validation framework
7. ✅ **Service Integration** - All services integrated with Config Server
8. ✅ **Monitoring and Alerting** - Full observability stack configured

## Conclusion
