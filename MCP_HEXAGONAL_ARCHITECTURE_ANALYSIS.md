# MCP Services Hexagonal Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the MCP services reveals a mixed implementation of hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters pattern). While some services follow the pattern well, others use traditional layered architecture.

## Services Following Hexagonal Architecture ✅

### 1. mcp-organization
**Status:** Well-implemented hexagonal architecture
- ✓ Clear domain layer with business entities (Organization, User, OrganizationSettings)
- ✓ Application layer with use cases and ports
- ✓ Proper port definitions (inbound/outbound)
- ✓ Adapter layer for web, persistence, and external integrations
- ✓ No dependency violations in domain layer

**Structure:**
```
organization/
├── domain/          # Core business logic
├── application/     # Use cases and ports
│   ├── port/
│   │   ├── inbound/  # Use case interfaces
│   │   └── outbound/ # Repository/service interfaces
│   ├── command/
│   └── query/
└── adapter/         # External integrations
    ├── web/         # REST controllers
    ├── persistence/ # Database adapters
    └── external/    # External service adapters
```

### 2. mcp-llm
**Status:** Well-implemented hexagonal architecture
- ✓ Domain layer with value objects (Provider, ModelName, TokenUsage)
- ✓ Clear separation of inbound/outbound ports
- ✓ Application layer with use cases
- ✓ Adapter pattern for external LLM providers

**Structure:**
```
llm/
├── domain/          # Core LLM concepts
├── application/     # LLM use cases
│   └── port/
│       ├── inbound/  # GenerateCompletion, StreamCompletion
│       └── outbound/ # LlmProviderGateway, CacheService
└── adapter/
    ├── web/         # REST API
    ├── external/    # LLM provider integrations
    └── persistence/ # Cache and persistence
```

### 3. mcp-debate-engine
**Status:** Good hexagonal implementation
- ✓ Rich domain model (Debate, Participant, Message)
- ✓ Domain ports for external dependencies
- ✓ Event-driven architecture support
- ✓ Clean separation of concerns

**Structure:**
```
debateengine/
├── domain/
│   ├── model/      # Debate aggregate
│   ├── event/      # Domain events
│   └── port/       # Repository, AIService interfaces
├── application/    # Debate orchestration
└── adapter/
    ├── event/      # Event publishing
    ├── web/        # WebSocket/REST
    └── persistence/# Database adapters
```

### 4. mcp-controller
**Status:** Good hexagonal implementation
- ✓ Domain layer with core debate control logic
- ✓ Application services with command/query separation
- ✓ Multiple adapter types (web, websocket, external)
- ✓ Clear port definitions

### 5. mcp-rag
**Status:** Partial hexagonal implementation
- ✓ Has domain layer with models
- ✓ Domain ports defined (VectorStore, ChunkingService)
- ⚠️ Mixed with traditional service/repository pattern
- ⚠️ Application ports not in standard location

## Services NOT Following Hexagonal Architecture ❌

### 1. mcp-auth-server
**Status:** Traditional layered architecture
- Uses simple package structure: config, entity, repository, service
- No domain modeling
- No port/adapter separation
- Direct coupling between layers

### 2. mcp-gateway
**Status:** Traditional layered architecture
- Standard Spring Boot structure
- Controllers directly use services
- No domain layer
- GraphQL resolver pattern (appropriate for gateway)

### 3. mcp-sidecar
**Status:** Traditional layered architecture
- Simple structure: controller, service, config
- Appropriate for its proxy/sidecar role
- No complex domain logic requiring hexagonal architecture

### 4. mcp-pattern-recognition
**Status:** Traditional modular structure
- Organized by features (detector, ml, reporting)
- No hexagonal layers
- Direct dependencies between modules

## Recommendations

### For Well-Architected Services
1. **Maintain consistency** in port naming and package structure
2. **Document** the architectural decisions and boundaries
3. **Enforce** dependency rules through build tools

### For Traditional Services
1. **mcp-auth-server**: Consider refactoring to hexagonal architecture
   - Extract domain concepts (User, Role, Permission)
   - Define authentication/authorization ports
   - Separate JWT handling into adapters

2. **mcp-gateway**: Current architecture is appropriate
   - Gateway pattern doesn't require hexagonal architecture
   - Keep it simple as a routing/aggregation layer

3. **mcp-sidecar**: Current architecture is appropriate
   - Sidecar pattern is infrastructure-focused
   - No complex domain logic to encapsulate

4. **mcp-pattern-recognition**: Consider partial refactoring
   - Extract core pattern detection logic to domain
   - Keep ML models as adapters
   - Define clear ports for extensibility

## Architecture Compliance Summary

| Service | Hexagonal | Domain Layer | Application Layer | Adapters | Ports | Overall |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-------|---------|
| mcp-organization | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Excellent |
| mcp-llm | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Excellent |
| mcp-debate-engine | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Good |
| mcp-controller | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Good |
| mcp-rag | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | Partial |
| mcp-auth-server | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | None |
| mcp-gateway | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A* |
| mcp-sidecar | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A* |
| mcp-pattern-recognition | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | None |

*N/A = Not applicable due to service nature

## Key Findings

1. **Inconsistent adoption**: Only 4-5 out of 9 services follow hexagonal architecture
2. **Clear benefits visible**: Services with hexagonal architecture have better separation of concerns
3. **Infrastructure services**: Gateway and sidecar appropriately use simpler architectures
4. **Migration candidates**: mcp-auth-server and mcp-pattern-recognition would benefit from refactoring
5. **Documentation gap**: No clear architectural decision records (ADRs) found
