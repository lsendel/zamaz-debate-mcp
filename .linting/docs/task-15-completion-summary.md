make test-integration-core
make test-integration-performance
make test-integration-workflow

# Generate coverage report
make test-coverage-report
```

#### Direct Execution

Tests can also be run directly:

```bash
# Simple integration test (recommended)
.linting/scripts/simple-integration-test.sh

# Advanced test suites
.linting/scripts/integration-test-suite.sh
.linting/scripts/performance-integration-tests.sh
.linting/scripts/workflow-integration-tests.sh
```
