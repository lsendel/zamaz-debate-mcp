# DEPRECATED: Debate MCP Service Architecture

**This document is deprecated.** The architecture described here, primarily a Python-based MCP service, has been superseded.

The current system architecture is a Java-based microservices application with a React/TypeScript frontend.

For the most up-to-date and comprehensive architectural overview, please refer to:

*   **`docs/architecture/README.md`**

This project has evolved from an initial Python-based prototype to a more robust and scalable Java microservices architecture. The Python components previously described in this document are no longer in active use.
