## FAQ

**Q: Can I use multiple flows on the same participant?**
A: Yes, but only one flow executes per response. The system selects the most appropriate based on context.

**Q: How do flows affect API usage?**
A: Complex flows use more API calls. Monitor usage in analytics dashboard.

**Q: Can I create custom flow types?**
A: Currently, custom flows aren't supported, but you can extensively configure existing types.

**Q: Do flows work with all AI models?**
A: Flows work with all supported models, but performance varies. Larger models generally perform better with complex flows.

**Q: How do I know which flow was used for a response?**
A: Check the flow indicator icon next to each response. Click "View Details" for full execution information.

**Q: Can flows be shared between debates?**
A: Flow configurations can be saved as templates and reused across debates within your organization.

**Q: What happens if a flow fails?**
A: The system falls back to standard response generation. Failed executions are logged for debugging.

**Q: How do confidence scores work?**
A: Confidence is calculated based on flow-specific metrics. Higher scores indicate more reliable responses.

**Q: Can I export flow analytics?**
A: Yes, analytics can be exported as CSV or JSON from the analytics dashboard.

**Q: Is there a limit to flow configurations?**
A: Free tier: 5 flows per debate. Pro: 20 flows. Enterprise: Unlimited.
