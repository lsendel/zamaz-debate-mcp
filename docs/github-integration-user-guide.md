2. **Configure Your Repository**
   - Create a `.kiro/config/github.yml` file in your repository
   - Use the example configuration provided below

### Basic Configuration

## Using Kiro for Code Reviews

### Assigning Pull Requests

1. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Create your PR as usual in GitHub

2. **Assign Kiro as Reviewer**
   - In the PR sidebar, click "Reviewers"
   - Add "kiro-ai" as a reviewer
   - Kiro will automatically start reviewing your code

3. **Request Review via Comment**
   - Comment `/kiro review` in your PR
   - Kiro will begin the review process

### Understanding Kiro's Comments

Kiro provides different types of feedback:

#### Issue Comments
- **üî¥ Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, syntax errors
- **üü† Major**: Performance issues, potential bugs
- **üü° Minor**: Style violations, minor improvements
- **üí° Suggestion**: Best practice recommendations

#### Fix Suggestions
Kiro provides automated fix suggestions using GitHub's suggestion blocks:

```suggestion
// Improved code goes here
```

You can apply these suggestions directly by clicking "Add suggestion to batch" in GitHub.

### Commands

Use these commands in PR comments to interact with Kiro:

- `/kiro review` - Request a code review
- `/kiro help` - Show available commands
- `/kiro explain [file:line]` - Get explanation for specific code
- `/kiro fix [file:line]` - Request automated fix
- `/apply-suggestion` - Apply a suggested fix

## Advanced Features

### Custom Rules

You can define custom rules for your team:

```yaml
rules:
  rule_sets:
    - name: "Team Standards"
      enabled: true
      rules:
        - id: "no-console-log"
          severity: minor
          description: "Avoid console.log in production code"
          pattern: "console\\.log\\("
          message: "Use proper logging instead of console.log"
```

### Team Coding Standards

Configure team-specific standards:

```yaml
team_standards:
  indentation:
    style: spaces
    size: 2
  line_length: 80
  naming_conventions:
    variables: camelCase
    functions: camelCase
    classes: PascalCase
    constants: UPPER_CASE
```

### Notification Settings

Configure how you receive notifications:

```yaml
notifications:
  channels:
    - github
    - slack:
        webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
        channel: "#code-reviews"
    - email:
        recipients:
          - "team@example.com"
  events:
    - review_complete
    - critical_issue
    - fix_applied
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Kiro doesn't respond to PR assignment**
- Check that the GitHub App is installed
- Verify Kiro has necessary permissions
- Ensure the repository is included in the installation

**Reviews take too long**
- Large PRs take more time to review
- Check your review depth setting
- Consider breaking large PRs into smaller ones

**Too many false positives**
- Adjust rule severity levels
- Disable problematic rules
- Provide feedback to help Kiro learn

**Suggestions don't apply cleanly**
- Code may have changed since suggestion was made
- Apply suggestions manually if needed
- Refresh the PR if conflicts occur

### Getting Help

1. **Check the Documentation**
   - Review this guide thoroughly
   - Check the API documentation
   - Look at example configurations

2. **Use Built-in Help**
   - Comment `/kiro help` in any PR
   - Check the GitHub App settings page

3. **Contact Support**
   - Create an issue in the repository
   - Contact your system administrator
   - Check the troubleshooting guide

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling

- Kiro only processes code that you explicitly assign for review
- Code analysis happens in secure, isolated environments
- No code is stored permanently after review completion
- All data processing complies with GDPR and privacy regulations

### Permissions

Kiro requires these GitHub permissions:
- **Pull requests**: Read & write (to comment on PRs)
- **Contents**: Read (to analyze code)
- **Issues**: Read (to understand context)
- **Metadata**: Read (to access repository information)

### Security Features

- All webhook communications are signed and verified
- Access tokens are encrypted and regularly rotated

## Feedback and Improvement

Kiro learns from your feedback to provide better suggestions over time:

- **Negative Feedback**: üëé reactions, "not helpful" comments
- **Specific Feedback**: Detailed comments about suggestion quality

Your feedback helps Kiro:
- Improve suggestion accuracy
- Learn team preferences
- Adapt to coding standards
- Reduce false positives

## Conclusion

The Kiro GitHub Integration streamlines your code review process by providing intelligent, automated feedback. By following this guide and configuring Kiro appropriately for your team, you can significantly improve code quality while reducing manual review overhead.
