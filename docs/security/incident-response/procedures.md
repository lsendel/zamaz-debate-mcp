mkdir -p /secure/$CASE_DIR

# Collect system logs
./scripts/security/collect-logs.sh --output=/secure/$CASE_DIR/logs

# Capture container state
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) > /secure/$CASE_DIR/containers.json

# Database logs
./scripts/security/db-logs.sh --days=7 --output=/secure/$CASE_DIR/db-logs

# Configuration snapshot
./scripts/security/config-snapshot.sh --output=/secure/$CASE_DIR/configs
```

### Chain of Custody

- Document who collected each piece of evidence
- Record when and how evidence was collected
