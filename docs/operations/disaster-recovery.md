# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the MCP Debate System, including backup strategies, recovery processes, and business continuity plans.

## Recovery Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours maximum
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Service Level**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year)

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Service Failure
- **Impact**: Degraded functionality
- **Recovery**: Automatic failover or service restart
- **RTO**: 5 minutes
- **RPO**: 0 (no data loss)

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption
- **Impact**: Data unavailable
- **Recovery**: Database restore from backup
- **RTO**: 2 hours
- **RPO**: 1 hour

### Scenario 3: Complete Infrastructure Loss
- **Impact**: Complete service outage
- **Recovery**: Full infrastructure rebuild
- **RTO**: 4 hours
- **RPO**: 1 hour

### Scenario 4: Security Breach
- **Impact**: Potential data compromise
- **Recovery**: Security incident response
- **RTO**: 8 hours
- **RPO**: 1 hour

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

#### Database Backups
```bash
# Daily full backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /opt/mcp/scripts/backup/backup-database.sh

# Hourly incremental backups during business hours
0 9-17 * * * /opt/mcp/scripts/backup/backup-database.sh --incremental
```

#### Configuration Backups
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Storage**: Local + S3
- **Includes**: 
  - Application configurations
  - Kubernetes manifests
  - SSL certificates
  - Environment variables (encrypted)

#### Redis Backups
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours
- **Method**: BGSAVE with file copy
- **Retention**: 7 days
- **Storage**: Local + S3

### Backup Verification

Daily backup verification process:
1. Integrity check of backup files
2. Test restoration to staging environment
3. Verification of restored data
4. Performance benchmarks on restored system

## Recovery Procedures

- [ ] Begin restoration from backups
- [ ] Monitor recovery progress
- [ ] Update stakeholders

#### Full Recovery (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Complete system restoration
- [ ] Verify data integrity

- [ ] Resume normal operations

### Service-Specific Recovery

#### PostgreSQL Recovery
```bash
# Stop all services using the database
docker-compose stop mcp-organization mcp-gateway mcp-debate-engine mcp-rag

# Restore database from backup
./scripts/recovery/restore-database.sh --type postgres --file latest

# Verify data integrity
psql -U postgres -d debate_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM debates;"

# Restart services
docker-compose start mcp-organization mcp-gateway mcp-debate-engine mcp-rag
```

#### Redis Recovery
```bash
# Stop Redis and dependent services
docker-compose stop redis mcp-gateway mcp-debate-engine

# Restore Redis data
./scripts/recovery/restore-database.sh --type redis --file latest

# Restart services
docker-compose start redis mcp-gateway mcp-debate-engine
```

#### Application Recovery
```bash
# Restore configuration files
./scripts/recovery/restore-database.sh --type config --file latest

# Rebuild and restart containers
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# Verify service health
./scripts/maintenance/health-check.sh
```

#### Kubernetes Recovery
```bash
# Restore Kubernetes resources
./scripts/recovery/restore-database.sh --type k8s --file latest

# Wait for pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod --all -n production --timeout=300s

# Verify ingress and services
kubectl get ingress,svc -n production
```

## Infrastructure Recovery

### Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)

#### VPC and Networking
```bash
# Deploy VPC from Terraform
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Verify networking
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=tag:Environment,Values=production"
```

#### EKS Cluster
```bash
# Create EKS cluster
eksctl create cluster --config-file infrastructure/eks-cluster.yaml

# Install ingress controller
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/ingress-nginx/

# Deploy cert-manager
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/cert-manager/
```

#### RDS Database
```bash
# Restore RDS from snapshot
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
    --db-instance-identifier mcp-debate-prod \
    --db-snapshot-identifier mcp-debate-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Update connection strings in secrets
kubectl patch secret database-credentials -n production \
    --patch '{"data":{"host":"<new-rds-endpoint>"}}'
```

### On-Premises Recovery

#### Hardware Replacement
1. **Provision new hardware** according to specifications
2. **Install base operating system** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
3. **Configure networking** and firewall rules
4. **Install Docker and dependencies**
5. **Restore application from backups**

#### Storage Recovery
```bash
# Mount backup storage
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backup

# Restore application data
rsync -av /mnt/backup/mcp/ /opt/mcp/

# Restore database
./scripts/recovery/restore-database.sh --type all --file /mnt/backup/latest/
```
