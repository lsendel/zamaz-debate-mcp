## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Run validation script
./scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh production

# Expected output:
# ✓ All tests passing
# ✓ Docker images built
# ✓ Configurations valid
# ✓ Dependencies available
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Backup existing database
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d debate_db > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# Run migrations
kubectl apply -f k8s/agentic-flows/migration-job.yaml

# Verify migration
kubectl logs -f job/agentic-flows-migration
```

### 3. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
./scripts/deploy-agentic-flows.sh staging v1.0.0

# Run verification
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh agentic-flows-staging

# Run smoke tests
npm run test:e2e -- --env=staging
```

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-agentic-flows.sh production v1.0.0

# Monitor rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/agentic-flows-processor -n agentic-flows

# Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh agentic-flows
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Metrics being collected
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Performance within SLA

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures (3 consecutive)
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 5s (p95)
- Memory usage > 90%

### Manual Rollback Steps
```bash
# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/agentic-flows-processor -n agentic-flows

# Rollback database (if needed)
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d debate_db < backup-TIMESTAMP.sql

# Clear cache
redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Verify rollback
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh agentic-flows
```

## Communication Plan

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Notify team via Slack (#deployments channel)
- [ ] Create maintenance window if needed
- [ ] Update status page

### During Deployment
- [ ] Post updates every 15 minutes
- [ ] Monitor #alerts channel
- [ ] Keep incident response team on standby

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Send deployment summary
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Schedule retrospective

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All pods running (3/3 minimum)
- [ ] CPU usage < 70%
- [ ] Memory usage < 80%
- [ ] Response time p99 < 3s
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] Uptime > 99.9%

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Flow execution success rate > 95%
- [ ] Average confidence score > 80%
- [ ] User satisfaction maintained/improved
- [ ] No degradation in debate quality

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Slow cold starts
**Workaround**: Pre-warm pods with readiness probe
```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /actuator/health/readiness
    port: management
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 5
```

### Issue 2: High memory usage with Tree of Thoughts
**Workaround**: Limit max depth and branching factor
```json
{
  "maxDepth": 3,
  "branchingFactor": 3,
  "memoryLimit": "1GB"
}
```

### Issue 3: Rate limiting with external APIs
**Workaround**: Implement request queuing and caching
```yaml
rateLimiting:
  openai:
    requestsPerMinute: 50
    enableQueue: true
    cacheResults: true
```
