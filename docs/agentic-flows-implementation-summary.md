## Migration Path

### For Existing Debates
1. Flows are opt-in per debate
2. Default flows can be configured at organization level
3. Historical debates remain unchanged
4. Gradual rollout with feature flags

### Database Migrations
1. Non-breaking schema additions
2. Backward compatible changes
3. Zero-downtime migrations
4. Automated rollback capability

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Custom flow type creation
2. Flow composition (chaining flows)
3. A/B testing framework
4. Advanced analytics with ML insights
5. Flow marketplace for sharing

### Performance Improvements
1. GPU acceleration for large models
2. Edge caching for global distribution
3. Streaming responses for long executions
4. Batch processing optimizations

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. JSONB provides excellent flexibility for varied configurations
2. Hexagonal architecture enables clean separation of concerns
3. Async processing is crucial for LLM operations
4. Comprehensive testing prevents regression issues

### Process Improvements
