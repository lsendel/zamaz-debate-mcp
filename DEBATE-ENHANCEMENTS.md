### 3. Data Model Updates

**File**: `src/types/debate.ts`

Enhanced types to support:
```typescript
interface Debate {
  // ... existing fields
  subject?: string;
  externalContext?: string;
  resolution?: string;
  conclusions?: Record<string, string>; // participantId -> conclusion
}

interface DebateQuestion {
  mainQuestion: string;
  subQuestions?: string[];
  constraints?: string[];
  successCriteria?: string[];
}

interface DebateContext {
  background: string;
  relevantFacts?: string[];
  assumptions?: string[];
  scope?: string;
  outOfScope?: string[];
}
```
