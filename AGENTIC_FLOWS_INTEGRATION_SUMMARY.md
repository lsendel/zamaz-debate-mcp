# Agentic Flows Integration Summary

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The agentic flows feature has been successfully integrated into the Zamaz Debate MCP Services. All components are working and the feature is ready for use.

## 🧠 What Are Agentic Flows?

Agentic flows are advanced reasoning and decision-making patterns for AI agents that enhance the quality and transparency of AI responses in debates. They include:

1. **Internal Monologue** - Step-by-step reasoning display
2. **Self-Critique Loop** - AI reviews and improves its own responses
3. **Multi-Agent Red Team** - Simulates internal debate between different personas
4. **Tool-Calling Verification** - Uses external tools for fact-checking
5. **RAG with Re-ranking** - Enhanced document retrieval and ranking
6. **Confidence Scoring** - Provides confidence levels with responses
7. **Constitutional Prompting** - Applies rule-based constraints
8. **Ensemble Voting** - Generates multiple responses and selects the best
9. **Post-processing Rules** - Applies deterministic validation
10. **Advanced Strategies** - Tree of Thoughts, Step-Back Prompting, Prompt Chaining

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend Components
- **Domain Layer**: Core agentic flow entities and processors
- **Application Layer**: Flow management and execution services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database adapters and external tool integrations
- **API Layer**: REST and GraphQL endpoints

### Frontend Components
- **AgenticFlowConfig**: Configuration UI for setting up flows
- **AgenticFlowResult**: Visualization of flow execution results
- **AgenticFlowAnalytics**: Analytics dashboard for flow performance
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into debate detail pages and participant responses

## 🚀 How to Use Agentic Flows

### 1. Access the UI
```bash
# Start the services
./start-simple-services.sh

# Open the UI
open http://localhost:3004
```

### 2. Configure Debate-Level Flows
1. Navigate to a debate
2. Look for the "Agentic Flow Config" section
3. Select a flow type (e.g., Internal Monologue)
4. Configure parameters
5. Save the configuration

### 3. Configure Participant-Level Flows
1. In the debate detail page
2. Find the participant settings
3. Configure individual flows for each AI participant
4. Each participant can have different flow types

### 4. View Flow Results
- Flow results are displayed in participant responses
- Click "Show Agentic Flow Details" to see the reasoning process
- View confidence scores, tool calls, critiques, etc.

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
- View flow performance metrics
- Compare different flow types
- See trending flows and recommendations

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Debate-Level Configuration
```bash
# Configure debate flow
POST /api/v1/debates/{debateId}/agentic-flow
{
  "flowType": "INTERNAL_MONOLOGUE",
  "enabled": true,
  "parameters": {
    "prefix": "Let me think step by step...",
    "temperature": 0.7
  }
}

# Get debate flow
GET /api/v1/debates/{debateId}/agentic-flow
```

### Participant-Level Configuration
```bash
# Configure participant flow
POST /api/v1/debates/{debateId}/participants/{participantId}/agentic-flow
{
  "flowType": "SELF_CRITIQUE_LOOP",
  "enabled": true,
  "parameters": {
    "iterations": 2
  }
}

# Get participant flow
GET /api/v1/debates/{debateId}/participants/{participantId}/agentic-flow
```

### Analytics
```bash
# Get debate analytics
GET /api/v1/analytics/debates/{debateId}/agentic-flows

# Get flow statistics
GET /api/v1/analytics/agentic-flows/statistics

# Get trending flows
GET /api/v1/analytics/agentic-flows/trending
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run the integration test
node simple-ui-test.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. **UI Integration**: Open http://localhost:3004 and navigate to debates
2. **API Testing**: Use curl commands to test endpoints
3. **Flow Configuration**: Configure different flow types and parameters
4. **Result Visualization**: View flow results in debate responses
